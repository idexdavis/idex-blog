### Prerequisite

* Basic knowledge about one or more high level programming language, like Java, C#, C++. C# is more like a combination of C++ and Java in syntax. This tutorial will inevitably involve some basic C# codes, so hope you can understand it. I do will explain some codes if it goes hard.
* Basic knowledge about markup language, like HTML, XAML. You don't need to actually know how to write HTML. You just need to have a rudimentary idea about a HTML structure, because XAML is similar to HTML. 
* YOU HAVE PASSION!
