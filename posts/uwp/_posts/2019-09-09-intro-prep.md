I will teach you C# and XAML in this tutorial.

### Prerequisite

* Basic knowledge about one or more high level programming language, like Java, C#, C++. C# is more like a combination of C++ and Java in syntax. This tutorial will inevitably involve some basic C# codes, so hope you can understand it. I do will explain some codes if it goes hard.
* Basic knowledge about markup language, like HTML, XAML. You don't need to actually know how to write HTML. You just need to have a rudimentary idea about a HTML structure, because XAML is similar to HTML. 
* YOU HAVE PASSION!

### Useful Development Tools

I have written this article before, [here](https://blog.idexdavis.com/posts/others/2018-06-26-useful-app-uwp-develop/) is the link. Check it out.

### Introduction

#### What languages will be used? Three choice below.

* XAML and C# (pronounced as C Sharp)

* XAML and C++

* HTML and JavaScript

*We will mainly focus on the first one in this series.*

#### What are XAML and C#?

* XAML

  *Extensible Application Markup Language*. XAML is kind of a modified version of XML. Right now, you can simply consider XAML as a language for writing user interface.

* C#

  This is a logic programming language, just like C++, Java, Python, etc. C# is a powerful language as it combined lots of advantages from C++ and Java. 

#### What do you need?

* A computer which has Windows as the full version of Visual Studio only runs on Windows.
* Visual Studio 2019 Community for this series.
* A BRAVE HEART

### The Installation of Visual Studio

* You can download the installation app of Visual Studio right through the [official website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com). Then click download Visual Studio IDE.
* After finishing download, run the installation app and you will follow the instruction to install Visual Studio Installer first.
* After installing the Visual Studio Installer, you may start to install Visual Studio. Find out the Visual Studio 2019 Community under the `Available` tab and click the install button,
* Make sure the `Universal Windows Platform Development` is selected and click the install button locates at the bottom right corner. Then waiting!
* After finishing downloading and installing, you will have basically a environment for UWP development. It's so easy!
