### Let's get started!

*The order of all combined shortcuts listed below does matter a lot. Take the first one as an example, you have to press `Ctrl` first, then `K`, then`D`. `Ctrl` and `K` should remain pressed down during the entire process.*

1. **Ctrl + K + D**

   **Format code**

   This shortcut will make Visual Studio to automatically format your code, fixing the incorrect indentation or removing the redundant space. You don't have to format your code manually.

2. **Ctrl + K + C**

   **Comment selection**

   This shortcut will comment out all codes you selected.

3. **Ctrl + K + U**

   **Uncomment selection**

   Basically, the reverse process of the previous one.

4. **Ctrl + Shift + S**

   **Save all the files**

   This key combination helps you to save files in Visual Studio at once. You don't need to save each file separately anymore.

5. **F12**

   **Jump to definition**

   Jump to the definition of certain function pointed by your cursor. You can actually achieve the same goal by right click and click the correct menu item, but this shortcut will save you a lot of time.

6. **Alt + Enter**

   **Open error prompt**

   When there are red marks in your code, use this shortcut to expand the information of the errors.

7. **Ctrl + R**

   **Rename**

   Rename in the programmer world can be messy, Using this shortcut would rename all the occurrences of the selected element.

8. **Ctrl + Shift + B**

   **Build solution**

9. **Type "prop" in Workspace and Double-Click tab**

   Visual Studio will create a new property based on template, saving your time of typing some many repeated characters.
